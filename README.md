## Summery
This bot was fully made by Adib23704 using LUA Language with Luvit SDK. It's fully open-source, you're allowed to change anything *(If you know what you're doing)*. But, keeping the credit of the developer is highly appreciated as it supports the developer.

#### Big Thanks to EvilInsult for their free API.
